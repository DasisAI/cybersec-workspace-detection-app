## Notes

### Detection Overlaps
Some existing "planned" detections from requirements already exist with different naming:
- ✅ `access_token_created.py` covers planned "Access_token_created"
- ✅ `group_created.py` covers planned "Group_created"
- ✅ `mfa_key_added.py` covers planned "Mfa_key_added"
- ✅ `mfa_key_deleted.py` covers planned "mfa_key_deleted"

### Future Enhancements
- Correlation rules combining multiple detections
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with SIEM platforms
- Automated response workflows
- Custom detection templates
